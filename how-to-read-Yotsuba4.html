    <li>Women generally only use it when talking to themselves, and you might hear phrases like these <b>頑張るぞ</b>(the way you might say "let's go!” to yourself before getting down to some work)</li>

    <li>It's not used in polite speech and can come off very strongly. <b>ぜ</b> basically means the same thing but sounds a bit less harsh.</li>
    <li>Examples:<b>
        <br>殺すぞ </b>(I'm going to kill you)
        <br><b>そのビールうまいぜ</b> (that beer is delicious)
    </li>
