<h2 class="text-center">6.Casual Articulation</h2>      
<ul type="circle">
    <li>In casual speech, sometimes words are said in a way that is more drawly and that broadens out the sounds. Depending on the context, this can be seen as masculine, unrefined, and/or emotional.</li>
    <li>While it is impossible to give an exhaustive list, you can look for certain patterns. Adjectives like <b>すごい</b> will often be pronounced <b>すげえ; うるさい</b> can become <b>うるせえ</b> or even <b>うっせえ.</b></li>

    <li>This can happen with verb endings like <b>～ない</b> and <b>～たい</b> too.</li>
    <li>Examples:<b>
        <br>全然できない → 全然できねえ</b> (I can't do it at all)
        <br><b>酒が飲みたい → 酒が飲みてえ</b> (I want to drink)
        <br><b>勉強したくない → 勉強したくねえ</b> (I don't want to study)</li>
